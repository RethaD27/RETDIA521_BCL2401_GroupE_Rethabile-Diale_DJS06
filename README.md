# JavaScript  Array Operations

This repository contains JavaScript code demonstrating various array operations using 'forEach', 'map', 'filter', 'sort', and 'reduce' functions.

## Descriptions
The code provided in this repository demonstrates how to perform common array operations in JavaScript using the following methods:
* 'forEach': Iterating through arrays and logging each element to the console.
* 'map': Transforming each element of an array to uppercase, calculating name lengths, and checking for the presence of the letter 's'.
* 'sort': Sorting the provinces alphabetically.
* 'filter': Filtering out provinces that contain the word "Cape".
* 'reduce': Creating an object mapping names to provinces.

## File Structures
* scripts.js
* advanced.js
* README.md

## Usage
* Open the 'scripts.js' and 'advanced.js' files.
* Type or copy and paste the codes into your JavaScript environment.
* Run the code to see the output in the console.
